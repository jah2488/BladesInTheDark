# The Gardens

> Bookended between two massive gray stone walls, so tall, that they reach into the sky until they seem to blend away into the gray sky above, there is a vast field of cultivated land, full of wildly and curly weeds, tall stalks of unknown vegetables, and the rare fruit. The air is thick and oddly humid. It smells of rotting fish, fresh tilled earth, and sweat. The vast fields are protected from the storms and the sun by a large tarp covering the entire length of the field. The tarp, upon closer inspection, is the dried flesh of a giant eel.
