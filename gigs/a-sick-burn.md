# A Sick Burn


## Background
  Oliver Tainly, at your service. Meg did this on purpose, we had a thing, a good thing, and she ruined it.
I was the Tavern and she was the Butcher, it was all in the names and she was right across the street, it was perfect. Then she just moved across the market, I get no traffic and no roasts, now I'm stuck next to the guard house, with no roasts, and I'm the guilded roasts. She sells brie now? Time she got hers.

## Task
Ruin all of the meat in [Butcher & Brie](butcher-and-brie), preferably poison, and burn the brie.

## For
 - The Guilded Roast

## Against
 - Butcher & Brie
