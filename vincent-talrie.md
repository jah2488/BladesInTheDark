# Vincent Archibald Pennington Talrie III

### Appearance
> A tall and slender man, who seems more handsome than his age should allow, with a chiseled jaw and a mop of blonde hair carefully waxed and styled. His eyes portray an energy and fire that few can match. His face is never without a mischievous smirk and telling wink. - Vincent Talrie
