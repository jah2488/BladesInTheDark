# The City

### Name
> The city has gone by many names over the years, _The City By The Sea_, _The City On The Edge_, _The City At Dawn's Break_, _The TriCity Made Whole_, _The Unification City_, _The City of Last Light_, _The City of Known Tomorrow_, _Edge_, but many of us, we just call it The City, because we also call it home, and because its easier that way.

### Background
> What you need to know is that The City did not spring up over night by some demigod's decree, nor was it founded by some band of adventurers looking to protect their home. No, this city was built over an eon of fighting, expansion, bartering, trading, backstabbing, and negotiating. What we have here is a testament to the greatness that is achievable by the various peoples of Loterah and the example of all the evils that can be found within them as well.

Like any city, there are a lot of competing interests and goals, The TriCity is no exception, mystics, fanatics,
and shady business owners push and pull against each other to further their own interests. Sometimes the most effective means of change is go outside of the law. 

### Why We Cant Leave
> Edge has found itself a peculiar city, in a peculiar time in history. Built on the top of a cliff at the end of a mountain range, at the farthest most north western peak of Altera, it would be considered a remote destination if it wasn't so large and self sufficient. Its tri city history has benefited the city in these times. For those who haven't left the city much recently, what you need to know is that getting out is easy, getting anywhere else alive is hard. The lightning storms threaten to tear apart any caravan or group traveling for any distance, but even if your luck holds out the heat storms from the west will bake you in your jacket before you can take it off. 


### Powerful Forces
> You see now, hopefully, that organizations are all the same, religions, governments, businesses, they're all a means to an end, and that end is _power_.

### The Way of the Deep
An ancient religion that predates the city itself is responsible for the most recognizable landmark of it, [The Spire](spire-the), a granite and limestone tower jutting up from the bat thousands of feet into the air to the cliff's edge. Its surface dark and shiny, as if the entire tower was coated in tar. Its interior is off limits to all but those who are still devote to The Way of the Deep.

As society grew around it, it had to change with the times, growing away from the worship of sea monsters, and subsequent sacrifice of the innocent to said sea monsters, and toward representatives on the city council. While its number of followers has diminished greatly, its level of influenced over the city has remained strong.

The Spire, and The Way of the Deep by extension, provides power to half the city and their technological and arcane advancements power our law enforcement and drive new innovations in commerce.

### The Granite Path (Stone's Grace)
A pragmatic and conservative religion that is slow to change and skeptical in nature. The followers of The Granite Path carved a city out of a mountain and dug an elaborate set of tunnels over the course of a millennia.  The far eastern side of the city, and the birth of industry in this city on a cliff, was thanks to The Granite Path and [The Iron Empire](iron-empire).

Followers of The Granite Path hold very few rituals and adherence to this religion is more a reflection of beliefs than a statement of faith or obligation. 

The Granite Path believes that officials and leaders come and go, it is only what you do with the time you have that matters. They value work, commerce, creativity, and ingenuity. 

They are mistrusting of the arcane and believe the dead should be left alone, for their time here is over.

They value things mined from the rocks and grown in the earth, over that found in the sea or conjured through mysticism. 

It is common for a member of The Granite Path to espouse their views by choosing oil and coal as their source of heat and light in a world growing more and more dependent on the arcane energies and eel powered devices.
